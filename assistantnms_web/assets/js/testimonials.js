review: `Thank you, fellow Traveller. This app makes so much of the game more understandable, organizational, and is the perfect companion to keep track of where you are at. No Man's Sky is so huge with so many moving parts, and it's constantly changing. This compendium guide is a must have by anyone who likes the game, even casually. Very highly recommended.`,

review: `A lot of thought and hard work has gone into making this superb app. Everything that I need to know is all in one place rather than going on Wiki every time I need information. I love the search option too which saves scrolling down. An easy five stars from me. Thank you!`,

review: `Fantastic and very helpful app! Maybe the only thing I could see as further expansion is including a frigate quality calculator or some other tools that might exist (the integration with the base power calculator is great!), but even that isn't really an issue since the quality of the app is superb.`,

review: `I recently downloaded No Mans Sky and I'd have to admit, with this app it keeps me from having to write everything down on notepad. I'm very fortunate to have this as a tool.`,

review: `Hate to use you're comment section to find people to run with or hey maybe you'd even run with me and build some settlements with me lol but seriously great app man it's helpful. But the discord chat you have linked to the app isn't very active is there any chance you could find another chat that stays active if not that's fine I know it can be hard`,

review: `It would be nice if there was shown how much frigate modules are needed for freighter technologies and also way to mark technologies/blueprints in technology tree that has been learned ( why is this app marked as having ads? I don't see any ads)`,

review: `Absolutely incredible app! Been playing NMS on PC/Steam for sometime now, and still need to refer back to Wiki's and what not. Found this app, and it's been super incredibly helpful, and the fact content is not locked behind a paywall is even better. I'd highly consider donating just for that. Seriously worth getting. Thank you so much!`,

review: `This is great, it's so useful and the UI is so tidy, nicely made and quite intuitive. It's saved me quite a lot of time, it's a lot quicker than just googling everything or getting increasingly frustrated as you try to find it on your own. (I sought this out when I found myself cursing a planet out.) Though one feature I'd love to have is just a note added about whether or not we need to raid a facility for a blueprint or something like that.`,

review: `An outstanding app with tons of information related to No Man's Sky. Keeping this handy on a mobile device while playing the game is an immense help. The app also has a record of expeditions, recipes, tips, and more. I can never remember all the recipes. This app saves you time in looking up the needed info. If you play No Man's Sky, get this app! Heck, get it even if you are curious about the game and check out all it's features.`,
