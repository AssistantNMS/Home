review: `Awesome... and 100% FREE!!!! Love this app has great tips and ingredient lists for craft-ables and refined materials. As well as an amazing support staff who really care about the game and the players who use their app. They keep it updated with the newest patches. And they also have a discord server where you can ask for help and/or bring up anything you may notice on the app that has not been perfected yet. Would definitely recommend for all level players of No Mans Sky, especially the new players who don’t know the mechanisms yet. Thank You!!!`,

review: `I love no mans sky, but I’m pretty add so I have spent literal hours in no mans sky forgetting mats and running around in circles collecting mats inefficiently.  Then of course, squirrel and all of my plans disappear into the ether.  This app an outstanding tracker, very glad that I came across it.  Helps me to track what I’d like to do next and what mats I’ll need for each of my bases-ships-freighters etc.  Took me a bit to optimize organization for my purposes but very worth it.    Now I can’t play the game without it, instead of searching all the time, I am actually playing while in game. `,

review: `This is excellent and Dev seems to stay on top of updates. I recommend this app to all members of the NMS Galactic Empire, NMS Cafe and to players in the NMS Amino. Thank you for keeping this up to date and look forward to your future work on this app (more updates to NMS in 2020). I am Grand Moff Willhuff Tarkin (NMS Galactic Empire)nand I was not compensated for this review.`,

review: `Compared ‘em all, and this app is easily the most thorough and integrated utility app in a fast, clean interface. For example, cactus flesh entry has full game summary, used to create, refined with, refine to create and cooking recipes all on one page for quick inspection - and every item is clickable to cross reference to that section. A visual database, tightly wired together, very nice!`,

review: `I am speechless and that has to mean something, good work with the app it helps me a lot and I can only recommend it for newcomers and veterans who play No man's sky. It is helpful and easy to use and since I do not know every recipe by heart, it has helped me with some things. Keep it up 👍`,
